While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message was vague, mentioning something about a missing dependency or a problem with the build process.  However, the usual troubleshooting steps (cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, checking package.json, etc.) didn't resolve the issue. The build process would seemingly hang indefinitely without any clear indication of what was wrong. This only happened on a specific machine, and worked perfectly on other machines.
