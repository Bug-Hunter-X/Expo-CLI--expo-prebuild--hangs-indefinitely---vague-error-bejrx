# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Hang Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command.  The build process would hang indefinitely without providing a clear error message. Standard troubleshooting techniques were unsuccessful in resolving the issue. This bug appears to be specific to certain development environments.

The `expoPrebuildBug.js` file contains a simplified reproduction of the project structure and code that led to the problem (although the exact cause is still unclear within this simplified example). The `expoPrebuildSolution.js` demonstrates a potential workaround, but doesn't definitively fix the root cause.

**Possible Causes (Speculative):**

* Underlying system issues (file permissions, OS-specific configurations)
* Conflicts with other installed software or packages
* Problems with the build system's caching mechanisms
* Incorrectly configured environment variables

**Note:** The exact cause remains undetermined, making the "solution" more of a workaround than a definitive fix. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the root problem.
