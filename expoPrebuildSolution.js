The exact cause of the `expo prebuild` hang was not directly identified, indicating a potential system-level or environment-specific problem. However, a potential workaround was discovered. The solution involved creating a fresh Expo project and carefully migrating only the essential code and dependencies.  This process excluded potential conflicts introduced by extraneous code or incorrectly configured dependencies.  After rebuilding the fresh project, the `expo prebuild` command worked as expected.  

To implement this workaround, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Expo project using `expo init NewProjectName`.
2. Manually copy the core app logic, essential components, and dependencies from your old project to the new one. Thoroughly check `package.json` to make sure that all dependencies are consistent and necessary. 
3. Test the app in the new project.  
4. Execute the `expo prebuild` command in the new project. If successful, gradually migrate remaining parts of the previous project into the new one, testing `expo prebuild` after each incremental migration.
